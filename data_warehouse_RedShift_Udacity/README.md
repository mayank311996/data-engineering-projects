## Overview

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

In this project, we will build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs users are listening to.

## Motivation 

To learn implementation and working of AWS Redshift and related services.

## Technical Aspect 

This project is divided into two part:

1. Getting data from S3 and loading into staging tables on AWS Redshift.
2. Loading data from staging tables to star schema to be used by analytics team.

## Dataset

We will be working with two datasets that reside in S3. 

#### [Song Dataset](s3://udacity-dend/song_data): 
It's a subset of real data from [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.

Sample Data:
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

#### [Log Dataset](s3://udacity-dend/log_data):
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this  [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim)  based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. 

Sample Data: 
```
{"artist":null,"auth":"Logged In","firstName":"Walter","gender":"M","itemInSession":0,"lastName":"Frye","length":null,"level":"free","location":"San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA","method":"GET","page":"Home","registration":1540919166796.0,"sessionId":38,"song":null,"status":200,"ts":1541105830796,"userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"","userId":"39"}
```

Log data json path: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json

## Table Schema

#### Fact Table
songplays - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong

    songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

#### Dimension Tables 
users - users in the app

    user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
songs - songs in music database

    song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

artists - artists in music database

    artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude

time -  timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units

    start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Run

> STEP 1

Fill both `dwh.cfg` and `cluster.cfg` configuration files.

> STEP 2 

Run `redshift_iac.py` to create IAM roles, security groups, and Redshift cluster on AWS.

> STEP 3

Run `create_tables.py` to create tables (staging and star schema).

> STEP 4 

Run `etl.py` to shift data from S3 to staging tables and then from staging tables to 
star schema.
