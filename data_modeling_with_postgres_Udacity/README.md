## Overview

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

In this project, we will build an ETL pipeline to load data from JSON files into Postgres tables.

## Motivation 

To learn implementation of star schema in Postgres and ETL pipeline to load the data.

## Technical Aspect 

This project is divided into two part:

1. Defining star schema in Postgres. 
2. Loading data from JSON files into Postgres tables.

## Dataset

We will be working with two datasets.

#### [Song Dataset](https://github.com/mayank311996/data-engineering-projects/tree/main/data_modeling_with_postgres_Udacity/data/song_data/A): 

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID

#### [Log Dataset](https://github.com/mayank311996/data-engineering-projects/tree/main/data_modeling_with_postgres_Udacity/data/log_data/2018/11):

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations. The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month.

## Table Schema

#### Fact Table

songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
- songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

#### Dimension Tables 

users - users in the app
- user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

songs - songs in music database
- song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

artists - artists in music database
- artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude

time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
- start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Run

>STEP 1:

Run `main.py` file under `src` directory to create tables and load data.

> STEP 2:

Run `test.ipynb` notebook under `notebooks` directory to execute test queries.
